# TuneShare Client

## Description

This is a mobile application where users can post their favorite music. We use Spotify API to provide music data. Users can search for song(s) that they like to create a post and to share it to their friends. Additionally, users can also browse all posts, leave comments and likes on the posts. 

Each post consits of the title of the song, the artist, the albumn cover. Furthermore, users also have the ability to listen to a preview of the song for 30 seconds.
